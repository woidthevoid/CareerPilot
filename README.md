# CareerPilot

Helping you pilot through you job search easily.

## What is it?
CareerPilot is a Flutter application that aims to make it easier to keep track of your applications and where in the proces they are, since it can be challening searching hundreds of jobs, forgetting which you applied to. The app is made for ios and macos in mind in the current state.

## Structure
CareerPilot is quite simple built, as it depends solely on a Supabase setup with authentication and database. In the future, a backend will be connected for the sole purpose of webs scraping job postings tailored to each individual preference. The app is built for mac and ios currently.

## Features
In the current build, you can sign up with email and password to create a account. When thats done, you can view your personal dashboard with a overview of how many applications you have made and how many of each status (not accepted offers as that will properly make you delete this app). You can add new jobs, view your current applied jobs, update jobs and delete them.
Simple as that!
### Future features
- Resume and cover letter upload
- Tailored job postings
- Timelines for job postings (applied, respond received etc)
- Goggle and Apple login
- and much more...
