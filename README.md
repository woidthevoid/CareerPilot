## Features
In the current build, you can sign up with email and password to create a account. When thats done, you can view your personal dashboard with a overview of how many applications you have made and how many of each status (not accepted offers as that will properly make you delete this app :) ). You can add new jobs, view your current applied jobs, update jobs and delete them.
Simple as that!
